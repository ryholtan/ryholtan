# Personal Introduction 👋

Hey all! I'm Ryan, and some of my earliest memories are of me taking apart a "robot dog" and putting it back together. Without me realizing it, that has become the theme of my life. Leading me to study Cybersecurity. I'm in my realm when I am dismantling something to learn more about it.
